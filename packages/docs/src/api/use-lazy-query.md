## Parameters

- `document`: GraphQL document containing the query. Can also be a `Ref` or a function that returns the document (which will be reactive).

- `variables`: (default: `null`) Variables object. Can also be a `Ref`, a reactive object or a function that returns the variables object.

    - `cache-only`: return result from cache if available, fail otherwise.
    - `network-only`: return result from network, fail if network call doesn't succeed, save to cache.

## Return

- `result`: result data object.

- `subscribeToMore(options)`: Add a subscription to the query, useful to add new data received from the server in real-time. See [Subscription](../guide-composable/subscription#subscribetomore).

- `onResult(handler)`: Event hook called when a new result is available.

- `onError(handler)`: Event hook called when an error occurs.
