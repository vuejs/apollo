## What is GraphQL?

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a specification that aims at easing the communication between frontends and backends. It mainly consists of a Schema Language for the server and a Query Language for the client.

## What is Apollo?

[Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) is a set of tools and community effort to help you use GraphQL in your apps. It's well known for its [client](https://www.apollographql.com/client) and its [server](https://www.apollographql.com/server).
