This library integrates [apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) in your [Vue](http://vuejs.org) components with declarative queries. Compatible with Vue 1.0+ and 2.0+. [Live demo](https://jsfiddle.net/Akryum/oyejk2qL/)

## What is GraphQL?

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a specification that aims at easing the communication between frontends and backends. It mainly consists of a Schema Language for the server and a Query Language for the client.

## What is Apollo?

[Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) is a set of tools and community effort to help you use GraphQL in your apps. It's well known for its [client](https://www.apollographql.com/client) and its [server](https://www.apollographql.com/server). Apollo is developped and supported by the [Meteor Development Group](https://www.meteor.io/).
